CMP3111M Software Engineering - Assignment

As software engineers, our job is not just about programming and writing lines of code, we must also
be aware of the larger context in which software and software systems are developed. In order to
develop and build an application we must first analyse the problem domain, providing software (and
design) solutions for challenges faced within the system to be developed.
Working within a Software Engineering methodology is an important part of being a developer,
understanding the roles and responsibilities within a software process allows you to understand the
flow of an artefacts development. As such in order to write a critical reflection on the SCRUM
methodology, you need to have been engaged in a SCRUM.
For this assignment, you are to work within the constraints of an agile methodology, namely that of
SCRUM. You will be assigned SCRUM teams (as discussed in Lectures and Workshops) and in these
teams, you must ensure that each of you contribute to the roles that exist within this methodology.
However, as is mentioned by the SCRUM process you can assume different roles at each iteration.
Whilst this assessment is an individually assessed piece of work, the group work required in
workshops is there to expose you to the process of SCRUM, which is a group based methodology.
